Sort Visualizer is a web application made for visualizing sorting algorithms.
<br></br>

It consists of **all 5 popular sorting algorithms**. This application is very **helpful for getting a deeper understanding of the sorting algos**, about how they work step-by-step. The application is completely **dynamic and customizable with a clean and minimal UI**. You can easily customize the size of the array, play/pause the animation, move forward and backward, restart the animation, and customize the speed of the animation.
<br></br>

The source code achieves a **very high level of abstraction**, as for adding any other sorting algorithm, we don’t have to build the complete UI again, we just have to add another algorithm in the algorithm’s module and that’s all, the UI would be built automatically.
<br></br>

The website is also having **Dark and Light both modes** to attract every kind of user.
<br></br>

All the pages are routed using **react router dom**. The main attraction of the project, is the architecture of the code. The project architecture, file and folder structure, and the naming conventions closely resembles to that of any real industry project. It is built keeping in mind the famous **Atomic Design** architecture. The project achieves a great level of **Abstraction** and **Encapsulation** by separating each functionality into separate files and modules. The code is completely modular and very easy to read and edit.
